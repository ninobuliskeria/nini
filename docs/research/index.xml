Both researchers and journal editors have incentives to publish unambiguous findings that convey a clear message. Competing for citation-based impact factors, editors often prefer to publish results that are (i) consistent with prior expectations and (ii) statistically significant. Authors, motivated by editors&amp;rsquo; preferences, may strive to provide such results. Therefore, editors and referees have one decision to make -  publish or reject the manuscript. While the researcher decides whether to submit the article to the journal (file drawer effect), they can be incentivized by editors and referees&amp;rsquo; preferences to engage in p-hacking, a practice to selectively report desired point estimates and standard errors, or choose the methodologies that yield such results. Enevthough selective submission and publication of papers solely with significant and large point estimates create publication bias, it is only a selection process that is applied to a group of individual point estimates, each of which may be unbiased for their corresponding population effects. Editors and referees typically carry out this process by deciding whether to publish a study, and authors by deciding whether to withhold a paper from publication. Whereas p-hacking introduces bias in point estimates within a study. Therefore, p-hacking can potentially pose a greater threat to the reliability of the literature than selective publication bias. The aim of this article is to identify and compare the extent of publication bias and p-hacking in the different states of research (published, working papers and never published literature), using a novel approach. I study the impact of reporting and publication biases using meta-data across 600 meta-studies and over 23000 studies that cover different fields of economics.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#This study differentiates between p-hacking from publication bias by identifying biases related to selective coefficient reporting as Selection Within Studies (SWS) and biases arising from selective publication as Selection Across Studies (SAS). Analyzing correlations between point estimates and their standard errors in a dataset of 400 meta-studies, which includes nearly 200,000 estimates from about 19,000 individual studies in economics and related social sciences, the research finds a consistently higher prevalence of SWS compared to SAS. This result highlights the significant impact of practices like p-hacking and method searching on selection bias in the economic literature, potentially skewing the perceived robustness of published results. The study highlights the need to simultaneously address the biases resulting from p-hacking and cross-study selection, extending the traditional concept of publication bias beyond just Selection Across Studies (SAS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study differentiates p-hacking from publication bias by examining biases resulting from selective reporting within studies versus selective publication of entire studies. Analyzing a dataset of 400 meta-studies, encompassing nearly 200,000 estimates from approximately 19,000 individual studies in economics and related social sciences, I observe a notably higher incidence of p-hacking as compared to selective publication. Employing various meta-regression methods, I find that selective reporting within studies is about 20% more prevalent than publication bias arising from selection among studies. This finding underscores the considerable influence of practices such as p-hacking and method-searching, suggesting that they contribute significantly to selection bias in the economic literature and could affect the perceived reliability of published findings.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uncertain Trends in Economic Policy Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://ninobuliskeria.com/research/uncertainty/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The news-based Economic Policy Uncertainty indices (EPU) of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom have discernible trends that can be found neither in other European countries nor in other uncertainty indicators. Therefore, we replicate the EPU index of European countries and show that these trends are sensitive to a rather arbitrary choice of normalizing the raw counts of news related to economic policy uncertainty by a count of all newspaper articles. We show that an alternative normalization by news on economic policy leads to different long-term dynamics with less pronounced trends and markedly lower uncertainty during recent uncertainty periods such as Brexit or the COVID-19 pandemic. Consequently, our results suggest that the effects of uncertainty related to these events on economic activity could have been overestimated.&lt;/p&gt;
