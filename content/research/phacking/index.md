abstract: Selective reporting of empirical results may distort our understanding of how robust the documented regularities are and give a false impression of their generalizability. Both researchers and journal editors have incentives to publish unambiguous findings that convey a clear message. Competing for citation-based impact factors, editors often prefer to publish results that are (i) consistent with the prior expectations and (ii) statistically significant. Authors may, in turn, strive to provide such results. Naturally, these findings raise doubts about the trustworthiness of established scientific knowledge. We study the impact of reporting and publication biases using meta-data across 600 meta-studies and over 23000 studies that cover different fields of social sciences â€“ economics and finance, agricultural and environmental, behavioral, psychological, and gender studies. First, we aim to develop a novel methodology that will allow us to distinguish between p-hacking and publication bias and identify research stages when these biases originate.
